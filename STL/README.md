STL is a simple file format for representing 3D objects as the
triangles which form their surface. It is common in 3D printing
workflows.

This Haskell library provides parsing and serialization to and from
both text and binary STL formats.

Documentation for the last release is
[on Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/STL).  The `examples`
directory contains a couple of simple command-line programs using the
library.

Bug reports, patches, and examples of use are welcome.
